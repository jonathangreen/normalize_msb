This program sorts all items within an ItemGroup of an MSBuild file
first by its BuildOrder and then by its file name.  It has primarily been
developed to simplify version control of Embarcadero RAD Studio project
files.  With every save of the project file RAD Studio permutes the order
of the items randomly leading to unnecessary conflicts in case of a merge.
